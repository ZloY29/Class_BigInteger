# Class_BigInteger
The eighth laboratory work in the first year of the Faculty of Mathematics of YarSU on the basics of programming in C++

Task: Long arithmetic.
The following libraries are allowed to be used in this task: iostream, vector
and string. It is forbidden to use any other libraries.
You need to write a BigInteger class to work with long integers.
The resulting class must support the following operations:
1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo remainder, working
in the same way as for int; compound assignment with these operations;
2. Unary minus, prefix and postfix increment and decrement;
3. Comparison operators ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=;
4. Output to the stream and input from the stream;
5. The toString() method, which returns a string representation of a number;
6. Construction from int (including implicit conversion when necessary);
7. Implicit conversion to bool when needed (should work in conditional
expressions).
In the input file, it is necessary to prepare a set of tests to check the operation of
the program.
